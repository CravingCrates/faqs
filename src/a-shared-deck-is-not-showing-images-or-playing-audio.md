# A shared deck is not showing images/playing audio

Some shared decks are missing sounds or images, either because the author expects you to download them from a separate location, or because they've accidentally or deliberately omitted them.

When downloading a shared deck from AnkiWeb, the number of included sounds and images is listed near the top of the download page.

If you've downloaded a shared deck from somewhere other than AnkiWeb and media files are not working, please contact the sharer for assistance.
