# My antivirus program says Anki is infected!

Antivirus programs sometimes get things wrong. This is especially so when we
release a new version - some AV programs assume that because the new version has
not been seen in the past that it must be dangerous. We are careful about
security, and the chances of a virus making it into an Anki release are very
slim. If you've received a message from your antivirus, please contact your AV
vendor to let them know about the false positive.
