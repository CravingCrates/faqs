# Requesting a refund for AnkiMobile

If you're having a problem with AnkiMobile, please let us know and we'll do our best to help you resolve it.

The App Store is run by Apple. When you purchase an app on it, you pay money to Apple. They keep part of your money, and
send the remainder to us about a month later. They do not tell us who has purchased the app, and do not
give us any ability to confirm you've made a purchase, or to initiate a refund. For this reason, any
refund requests need to be made to Apple directly.

Please note that except when required by law, refunds are at Apple's discretion. If it's your first time requesting a refund,
there's a good chance they'll refund your money, but this is not guaranteed.

We have heard reports that some Apple Support representatives, when refusing a refund, are suggesting you
contact us instead. That is misleading, as they know we do not have access to your payment details,
and cannot confirm you've purchased the app, or remove your access to it. If Apple have refused to refund you,
unfortunately that is not something we can change.
