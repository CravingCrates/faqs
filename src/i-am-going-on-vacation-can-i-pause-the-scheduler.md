# I'm going on vacation. Can I pause the scheduler?

Being able to come back from a break to find Anki in exactly the same state you left it in may sound attractive, but unfortunately while it's easy to tell the computer to suspend its estimates of how quickly you are forgetting, it's not possible to suspend your memory, so memories will continue to decay if you don't review. If you paused the scheduler, you would be delaying the review of every card in your deck, increasing your chance of forgetting every one of them, even those that would normally have appeared after you returned from your break.

Anki does have a "Set Due Date" feature in the Browse screen that can change the due date of cards. You can use this to either to move cards to an earlier due date (allowing you to study more before you take a break), or to push cards back to a later date. Conservative changes are recommended - if you alter the due date of cards by too much, there is a good chance you will forget them and need to relearn them again.
