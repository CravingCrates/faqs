# Cyren are blocking our emails

Some email providers outsource spam checking to a company called Cyren.
Cyren inexplicably keep claiming that our emails are spam, causing email
providers that use Cyren to refuse to talk to AnkiWeb.

If you have access to an email address at another provider, the fastest solution
is to use the Account tab of AnkiWeb to change to your other email address.

If you do not have access to another email address, you could try asking
your email provider to remove 23.249.217.77 from Cyren's block list. If your
email provider are not able to help you out, you'll need to sign up for a
free email address at somewhere like gmail.com, as they reliably accept
email.
